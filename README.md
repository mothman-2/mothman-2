- 👋 Hi, I’m @mothman-2
- 👀 I’m interested in ... the ocean, art, and whatever story or game im currently hyperfixated on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to use github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing too big, im just here to help out devlopers by sending in bug reports for now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... send a carrier pigeon to my address. not telling you what the address is, just follow your heart.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... They/he/it
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... ultrakill lore states that all life on the planet died out due to lack of sunlight, but there's entire chemosynthetic ecosystems living around hydrothermal vents and brine pools deep in the ocean that are completely independant of the sun, so what im getting at is the tube worms in ultrakill are porbably fine.
